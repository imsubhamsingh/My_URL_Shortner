# My_URL_Shortner
A fast and efficient URL shoortner made in python that can  able to store a lot of links
#Design Goals
Here's what we came up with:

1. We should be able to store a lot of links, since we're not automatically expiring them.
2. Our shortlinks should be as short as possible. The whole point of a link shortener is to make short links! Having shorter      links than our competition could be a business advantage.
3. Following a shortlink should be fast.
4. The shortlink follower should be resilient to load spikes. One of our links might be the top story on Reddit.
